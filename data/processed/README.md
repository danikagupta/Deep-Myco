# Dataset files

## ðŸ“– Fungi Metadata File Generation

The file `fungi_taxonomy_enriched_v2.csv` was produced through a multi-stage workflow that extracts, normalizes, and enriches fungal species information from the experimental dataset.

### Steps in the Pipeline
1. **Source Data Extraction**
   - Original CSV: `PDF_Extract2 - pdf_extract_2025 (6).csv`
   - Columns used:  
     - `type of fungi`  
     - `any additional information`  

2. **Data Cleaning & Normalization**
   - Standardized species names (e.g., *P. chrysosporium* â†’ *Phanerochaete chrysosporium*).
   - Removed punctuation and harmonized abbreviations.
   - Retained the original raw label in the column `original_fungi_name`.

3. **Enzyme Extraction**
   - Parsed enzyme activities from the `any additional information` column using regex patterns.  
   - Supported enzymes include **laccase, manganese peroxidase (MnP), lignin peroxidase (LiP), versatile peroxidase (VP), cellulase, xylanase,** and others.
   - Results stored in the `enzymes_list` column.

4. **Taxonomy & MycoBank Integration**
   - Species names were mapped to **MycoBank IDs** where available.
   - Added lineage classification in the format:  
     `Kingdom > Phylum > Class > Order > Family > Genus > Species`.

5. **Synonym Resolution**
   - Applied synonym mappings from authoritative fungal taxonomy sources. Examples:  
     - *Coriolus versicolor* â†’ *Trametes versicolor*  
     - *Lentinus edodes* â†’ *Lentinula edodes*  
     - *Polyporus sanguineus* â†’ *Pycnoporus sanguineus*  
   - Introduced two new columns:  
     - `accepted_name`: standardized valid name  
     - `status`: one of **Valid**, **Synonym**, **Genus only**, or **Not available**

6. **Output**
   - **`fungi_taxonomy_enriched.csv`** â†’ First pass (basic enrichment).  
   - **`fungi_taxonomy_enriched_v2.csv`** â†’ Final enriched version with synonyms and status flags.

### Example Row

| original_fungi_name | species_name        | accepted_name       | MycoBankID | enzymes_list   | classification | status  |
|----------------------|---------------------|---------------------|------------|----------------|----------------|---------|
| Coriolus versicolor  | Coriolus versicolor | Trametes versicolor | 281625     | Laccase, LiP   | Fungi > â€¦      | Synonym |

### âœ… TODOs / Next Steps

- [ ] **Fill missing MycoBank IDs** â€” many species currently have blank entries.  
- [ ] **Expand taxonomy coverage** â€” not all genera have complete lineage information.  
- [ ] **Review ambiguous names** â€” e.g., *White-rot fungi*, *Whole fungi*, *Bjerkandera sp.* should be curated or excluded.  
- [ ] **Confirm synonym mappings** â€” some taxa (e.g., *Grammothele subargentea* â†’ *Porogramme subargentea*) may need expert confirmation.  
- [ ] **Add enzyme activity values** â€” right now only enzyme types are listed, but activity levels (U/mL, etc.) could be extracted into structured fields.  
- [ ] **Quality check** â€” verify that accepted names and classification hierarchies are consistent with the latest MycoBank records.
