Source Code

This directory contains the main source code for Deep-Myco.
It includes scripts and modules for data extraction, analysis, and modeling.

Subdirectories such as extraction_pipeline, prompt_sensitivity, and others each handle different parts of the project’s workflow.

Extraction pipeline - this is where you will find the code for extracting results from papers and for scoring papers.

Prompt sensitivity - code for analyzing how sensitive the extraction and scoring methods are to specific prompt styles (baseline, few shot and chain of thought)

ML models - code for training ML models for the time series data.
