  DeepMyco is a groundbreaking research project that leverages Large Language 
  Models (LLMs) to extract, analyze, and scale mycoremediation knowledge from 
  scientific literature. By systematically processing research papers, we've 
  created the first comprehensive dataset of mycoremediation experiments and 
  developed machine learning models to predict optimal fungal-pollutant 
  combinations for environmental cleanup applications. The project addresses 
  the critical challenge of scaling mycoremediation—the use of fungi to clean 
  up environmental pollutants—by consolidating scattered literature knowledge 
  and making it accessible through predictive models.
